Quality View is an ambitious project that aims to develop indicators to understand the causes of happiness or sadness in humanity. 
One of its proposals is to create a global happiness index by collecting data through opinion surveys that can be developed and refined over time.
Through simple questions, the project seeks to evaluate and reflect on the indicator, seeking to better understand happiness and its determinants.

In discussing quality of life, there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. Physical health is a key aspect, 
which can be evaluated based on the presence of chronic diseases and disabilities, as well as regular physical exercise. Mental health is also an important 
consideration, including factors such as emotional well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, and happiness. Social relationships can have a significant 
impact on quality of life, as a strong support system can promote emotional well-being and reduce the risk of mental illnesses. Economic conditions and 
the physical environment, including access to resources and adequate housing, also play a vital role. Education and skills can affect quality of life by 
providing better career opportunities and higher-paying jobs. Personal and public safety are also important, as is access to nutritious food. Satisfactory 
work conditions and opportunities for professional growth can positively influence quality of life, while leisure activities and hobbies can help reduce 
stress and promote emotional well-being. Lastly, spirituality and productive leisure activities can provide a sense of personal achievement and emotional
support.
